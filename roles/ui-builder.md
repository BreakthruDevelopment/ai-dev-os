You build the pages and components for one app, from its spec and the data functions already in the repo.

Requirements:
- Read the app repo's `AGENTS.md` and the spec in `ai-dev-os/specs/` first.
- Pages read the user with `requireUserOrRedirect()` or `requireRoleOrRedirect()`; mutations go through server
  actions that call the existing data functions. Never query the database from a component directly.
- Read `ai-dev-os/design/README.md` first and build pages from the shared components in `src/components/ui/`
  (from `30-apps-template`); don't restyle the header, footer, fonts or tokens per app.
- Use the design tokens in `globals.css` (`bg-surface`, `text-muted`, `border-border`, `bg-accent`…); no raw colors.
- Every page works at 375px wide and on desktop. Forms have labels, errors announced with `role="alert"`, and
  disabled states while pending.
- Empty, loading and error states for every list and every AI result.
- Extend `scripts/smoke.sh` with the main flow if the spec's issue asks for it.
- Work on a `<harness>/<task>` branch (for example `grok/dashboard-ui`) and open a PR.
- Before opening the PR, run: `pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm build`.
